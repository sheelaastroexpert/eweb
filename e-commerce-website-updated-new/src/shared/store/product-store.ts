/*
The @ symbol in an import statement is a path alias. It’s not a special character in JavaScript or TypeScript by default but rather a shorthand that’s been configured in your project’s build setup (like with Webpack, Vite, or in your TypeScript configuration).
Instead of using long, relative paths such as ../../../modules/products/types/product, you can use a simpler alias like @/modules/products/types/product to make your imports cleaner and easier to maintain.
